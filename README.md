# MoneyDownloader

MoneyDownloader is a program that tells you how much money you have saved by obtaining your media for free. It does this by scraping many websites and comparing streaming service prices to find the lowest general price. The program lists the streaming site on which it found the media and its price. The program then totals all of the costs together to give you the final amount of money you have saved. This media currently stretches to MUSIC and MOVIES/TV SHOWS. 

1) Execute the program and click on "start".
2) The start button will then prompt you to choose between selecting mutiple FILES or FOLDERS. Pick what you want
3) Choose the FILES or FOLDERS you want to import. This should be media like MUSIC or MOVIES/TV SERIES.
4) Once media is selected, it may take some time to load all of the media depending on the amount of items chosen to import.
5) Hit "Get Prices" and wait as the program fetches prices from various sources, compares them, finds the cheapest and spits out the cost.
6) At the bottom of the right box, you should see "Total Saved" with a number that has added all of the prices the program found together.

Extra notes: Some items may not be found if the naming of the files is weird, unspecific, or if the media is small, niche, or barely known.
